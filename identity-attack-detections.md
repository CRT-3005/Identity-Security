# 🔐 Identity Attack Detection

This section demonstrates how identity-based attacks against Active Directory are detected by Splunk Enterprise using Windows Security Event Logs.  
After validating log ingestion from the Domain Controller (ADDC01) and configuring advanced audit policies, a **Kerberos password spray attack** was simulated from the Kali attacker machine using **Kerbrute**.  
Splunk was then used to identify and analyze the Kerberos authentication events generated by this activity.

---

## **Objective**
To simulate and detect a Kerberos-based identity attack—specifically, a **Kerberos AS-REQ (TGT request)** triggered by an invalid password attempt—using **Kerbrute** from the attacker machine (192.168.10.250).  
This demonstrates how identity-centric authentication activity appears in Splunk and how analysts can detect credential-guessing attempts.

---

## **Attack Execution (Kali Linux)**

A single-user password spray was conducted using `kerbrute` with a small user list and controlled delay to avoid account lockouts.

```bash
echo "JNeutron" > /tmp/users.txt

kerbrute passwordspray \
  --dc 192.168.10.7 \
  -d ADProject.local \
  --delay 1000 \
  --safe \
  -v \
  /tmp/users.txt Welcome123
```

### **Figure 1 – Kerbrute Output**

The following output confirms Kerbrute successfully contacted the KDC running on the Domain Controller (192.168.10.7:88) and attempted authentication using an invalid password.

```
Using KDC(s):
  192.168.10.7:88
[!] JNeutron@ADProject.local:Welcome123 - Invalid password
Done! Tested 1 logins (0 successes)
```

## **Detection in Splunk**

To ensure full visibility even when EventCode extraction varies, a regex-assisted SPL query was used to extract Kerberos Account Logon events directly from the raw Security XML logs.  
This method is reliable even when Windows fields are inconsistently normalized.

### **Splunk Search (regex-assisted)**

```spl
index=identity host=ADDC01 source="WinEventLog:Security" earliest=-10m
| rex field=_raw "<EventID>(?<EventID>\d+)</EventID>"
| rex field=_raw "(?i)<Data Name=\"TargetUser(?:Name|Name)\">(?<TargetUserName>[^<]+)"
| rex field=_raw "(?i)<Data Name=\"IpAddress\">(?<IpAddress>[^<]*)"
| where _indextime>=relative_time(now(), "-5m")
| search EventID=4768 OR EventID=4771
| table _time _indextime EventID TargetUserName IpAddress host
| sort -_indextime
```

<img width="1882" height="795" alt="KerberosSplunkLogs" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8066f04-97cf-41a3-b736-f79cce8a4b0d" />

### **Figure 2 – Splunk Kerberos Detection**

Splunk successfully identified **EventID 4768**, showing that the Domain Controller processed the Kerberos TGT request made during the attack.

Key fields observed:

- **EventID:** 4768  
- **TargetUserName:** JNeutron  
- **IpAddress:** 192.168.10.250 (Kali attacker)  
- **host:** ADDC01 (Domain Controller)

This confirms that the identity-based attack triggered Kerberos authentication log activity on the DC and was successfully ingested and analyzed in Splunk.

---

## **Audit Policy Configuration (Domain Controller)**

To ensure Kerberos-related identity logs were fully captured, the following advanced audit subcategories were enabled:

```powershell
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Kerberos Authentication Service" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Kerberos Service Ticket Operations" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Credential Validation" /success:enable /failure:enable
```

Additional configuration included:

- **Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings…** → Enabled  
- Confirming user JNeutron requires Kerberos pre-authentication  
- Restarting the Splunk Universal Forwarder  
- Applying domain policies using `gpupdate /force`

---

## **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**

| Technique ID | Name | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| **T1110.003** | Password Spraying | Testing one password across multiple accounts to avoid lockout. |
| **T1558** | Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets | Interaction with the KDC during Kerberos authentication attempts. |
| **TA0006** | Credential Access | Core tactical goal—obtain or guess valid credentials. |

---

## **Summary**

This test demonstrates full end-to-end detection of a Kerberos-based identity attack:

1. **Kerbrute** performs a password spray against `JNeutron`  
2. **Domain Controller (ADDC01)** logs Kerberos authentication activity (EventID 4768)  
3. **Splunk** ingests and parses the Security log  
4. **Analyst** identifies suspicious Kerberos authentication behavior  

---

# 🔐 NTLM Password Spray Detection

Following the Kerberos authentication test, a second identity-focused attack was simulated, this time targeting **NTLM authentication**.  
This scenario demonstrates Splunk’s ability to detect credential-guessing attacks across both major Windows authentication protocols used in Active Directory.

While Kerberos failures generate **4768/4771**, NTLM authentication failures generate **EventID 4625**, which can reveal broad password spraying attempts across multiple identities.

---

## **Objective**

To execute and detect an NTLM password spray attack using **CrackMapExec (CME)** from the attacker machine (192.168.10.250), and verify that Splunk can ingest and analyze the resulting Windows Security events.

This demonstrates identity-focused detection coverage across NTLM authentication pathways.

---

## **Attack Execution (Kali Linux)**

A single-password spray was performed against several Active Directory accounts using CrackMapExec over SMB:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.10.7 \
  -d ADProject.local \
  -u /tmp/ad_users.txt \
  -p Winter2025!
```

<img width="1277" height="149" alt="NTLM-spray-CME" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/338cf322-08ea-425c-979a-72ce1aa9cb6e" />

### **Figure 3 – CrackMapExec NTLM Password Spray Output**

CrackMapExec attempted authentication against six domain users using a single password (`Winter2025!`) and returned **STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE** for each of them:

- **JNeutron**  
- **JBravo**  
- **SCheeks**  
- **PStar**  
- **HMontana**  
- **VDinkley**

All failures originated from **192.168.10.250**, consistent with a classic NTLM password spray.

---

## **Log Ingestion Adjustment**

Because the default Security sourcetype was filtering certain events, the Domain Controller’s Universal Forwarder was updated to ensure all Security events were forwarded to Splunk:

```ini
[WinEventLog://Security]
disabled = 0
renderXml = true
sourcetype = WinEventLog:SecurityAll
index = identity
```

This custom sourcetype reliably forwarded **EventID 4625** for NTLM logon failures.

---

## **Extracting NTLM Failures From XML**

Since Security logs were ingested in XML format (`renderXml = true`), custom extraction was required to pull out the username and source IP from `<Data>` fields.

The SPL below extracts:

- EventID  
- TargetUserName  
- IpAddress  

```spl
index=identity sourcetype="WinEventLog:SecurityAll" earliest=-15m
| rex field=_raw "EventID>(?<EventID>\d+)<"
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=_raw "Data Name='TargetUserName'>(?<TargetUserName>[^<]+)<"
| rex field=_raw "Data Name='IpAddress'>(?<IpAddress>[^<]+)<"
| table _time, EventID, TargetUserName, IpAddress
| sort -_time
```

<img width="1885" height="545" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d443b42d-060e-48dd-abdd-d580dcf062e4" />

### **Figure 4 – Extracted NTLM Authentication Failures**

This output confirms:

- Six unique domain accounts failed authentication  
- All failures originated from **192.168.10.250**  
- All produced **EventID 4625**  
- All occurred within the same second, a strong indication of a spray attempt  

---

## 🔍 **NTLM Password Spray Detection Logic**

To detect NTLM password spray activity, a correlation rule was built to identify:

- Multiple authentication failures  
- From the same source IP  
- Targeting multiple distinct accounts  
- Inside a short time window  

```spl
index=identity sourcetype="WinEventLog:SecurityAll" earliest=-15m
| rex field=_raw "EventID>(?<EventID>\d+)<"
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=_raw "Data Name='TargetUserName'>(?<TargetUserName>[^<]+)<"
| rex field=_raw "Data Name='IpAddress'>(?<IpAddress>[^<]+)<"
| bucket _time span=5m
| stats dc(TargetUserName) as unique_accounts count by IpAddress, _time
| where unique_accounts >= 3
| sort -_time
```

If an attacker fails to authenticate against three or more distinct accounts within five minutes, this SPL flags the activity as a password spray.

---

## **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**

| Technique ID | Name | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| **T1110.003** | Password Spraying | Testing a single password across many accounts |
| **T1078** | Valid Accounts | Potential follow-on if credentials are obtained |
| **TA0006** | Credential Access | Attempting to guess valid passwords |

---

## **Summary**

This NTLM attack validates Splunk’s ability to detect identity-focused threats across multiple authentication protocols:

- **CrackMapExec** performed a real-world NTLM password spray  
- **EventID 4625** failures were ingested via a custom Security sourcetype  
- **Regex extraction** parsed usernames and IPs from XML logs  
- A **behaviour based correlation detection** identified the spray  
- Together with the Kerberos test, this provides complete authentication-layer visibility  

This scenario reinforces the importance of SIEM-driven identity security monitoring and shows how Active Directory authentication activity can be analyzed to detect adversarial behaviour.

## 🔍 Detection Summary Table

This table compares the two identity-based attacks executed in the lab and summarizes how each was detected within Splunk.

| **Detection Type** | **Authentication Protocol** | **Event IDs Observed** | **Attack Tool** | **Target Accounts** | **Splunk Detection Logic** | **What It Reveals** |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Kerberos Password Spray** | Kerberos | 4768, 4771 | Kerbrute | Single-user spray (`JNeutron`) | Regex-assisted extraction of Kerberos AS-REQ failures from Security XML | TGT requests with incorrect passwords, evidence of Kerberos authentication probing |
| **NTLM Password Spray** | NTLM | 4625 | CrackMapExec | Multi-user spray (`6 accounts`) | Correlation search counting distinct usernames per source IP within 5 minutes | Broad authentication failures across multiple accounts, evidence of automated NTLM spraying |

---

## ⭐ Key Takeaways

- **Identity-layer attacks are noisy when monitored correctly.**
  Even simple password spray attempts generate rich authentication telemetry across Kerberos and NTLM.

- **Kerberos and NTLM behave differently in logs.**
  Kerberos relies on AS-REQ failures (4768/4771), while NTLM produces failed logons (4625). Both require different SPL extraction techniques.

- **XML-formatted Security logs require custom field extraction.**
  Using `renderXml = true` improves fidelity but requires regex for fields like `TargetUserName` and `IpAddress`.

- **Detection relies on correlation, not single events.**
  Password sprays only become obvious when counting distinct usernames targeted within a time window.

- **Splunk Universal Forwarder configuration matters.**
  A custom sourcetype (`WinEventLog:SecurityAll`) ensured that no Security events were filtered out.

- **Realistic adversary emulation strengthens detection engineering.**
  Using Kerbrute and CrackMapExec mirrors real attacker behaviour and validates detection logic under real-world conditions.

- **This lab demonstrates full identity-attack visibility.**
  Both Kerberos and NTLM pathways were monitored, ingested, extracted, and correlated inside Splunk.
